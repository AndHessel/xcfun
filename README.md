## Contribution guide

- All patches are contributed through fork-pull request mechanism.
- We do not require any formal copyright assignment or contributor license
  agreement. Any contributions intentionally sent upstream are presumed to be
  offered under terms of the LGPL version 3.0.
- Maintainers do not push directly to the repository.
- Maintainers do not review their own patches.
- Approval of one maintainer is sufficient for trivial patches.
- Trivial patches are typos and trivial bugfixes.
- For any patch that is not trivial, two maintainers need to sign off the patch.
- **TODO**: We need to better define what "trivial" means.

## Configuration

Check that `XC_MAX_ORDER` is defined to the highest order derivatives
you need (and not higher) in `src/config.h~.  Using a too large value
for `XC_MAX_ORDER` makes compilation slow and the generated code huge.

## Building a debug/development version

Edit the Makefile that matches your compiler
(Makefile.gcc or Makefile.intel or ...)
to set CXX (C++ compiler) and flags and run

    $ make -f Makefile.gcc

(or using the corresponding Makefile)
This will create the library file `lib/libxcfun.so`

## Building an optimized version

Edit the Makefile that matches your compiler
(Makefile.gcc or Makefile.intel or ...)
and add `-DNDEBUG` to the compiler flags. Add optimization
compiler options. Make sure your compiler performs inlining
(-O3 with gcc).
